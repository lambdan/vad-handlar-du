# Where to get receipts

## Coop

Use the Coop app, and go into the Scan & Pay section. You can download them as PDF there.

## ICA

Make them appear in Kivra somehow (you need to link your bank account or something... I cant remember :D)

Once that's done, you can go into Kivra and download them as PDF there.
